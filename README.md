# Vulcan Rocket Simulator

**Vulcan Rocket Simulator** is a modular simulation environment that combines thrust-phase dynamics from [RocketPy](https://github.com/RocketPy-Team/RocketPy) with custom coast-phase control logic for airbrake deployment. The project is intended to support both automatic and manual control strategies and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to streamline simulation setup, execution, and result visualization.

## ðŸš€ Project Vision

The simulator models a full suborbital rocket flight profile, divided into two main phases:

1. **Thrust Phase** (powered ascent):
   - Simulated using RocketPy based on solid motor `.eng` files and rocket geometry.
   - Outputs include velocity, altitude, acceleration, quaternions, and position data.

2. **Coast Phase** (post-burnout control):
   - Simulated using custom differential equations based on drag, gravity, and airbrake dynamics.
   - Airbrake control can be:
     - **Manual** (triggered at specific altitudes or times),
     - **Automatic** (via PID control logic).
   - Outputs are computed in discrete time, using either Euler or `solve_ivp` integration.

## ðŸ§° MATLAB Integration

During early development, coast-phase dynamics and control logic were implemented and validated using MATLAB. These scripts are preserved in `/matlab` for reference and legacy testing.

### Integration Methods:
- **Short-term**: Exchange data using `.csv` files between RocketPy and MATLAB.
- **Long-term**: Transition MATLAB models fully into Python using `scipy`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

> You can also call MATLAB from Python using the `matlab.engine` API for more seamless integration, if needed.

## âœ… Roadmap / To Do

- [ ] Wrap RocketPy simulation and extract relevant state data
- [ ] Port MATLAB coast-phase and control logic to Python
- [ ] Implement hardcoded deployment logic (`deploy after 10s`, `at 700m`, etc.)
- [ ] Create GUI to configure, run, and visualize simulations
- [ ] Export full trajectory to CSV and KML
- [ ] Display RocketPy and coast-phase plots in GUI

## ðŸ“Œ Status

> **ðŸ“¦ In Planning / Prototyping Phase**

Initial modules are being structured. MATLAB-to-Python porting is planned. GUI frontend will follow after integration of coast-phase and RocketPy outputs.
